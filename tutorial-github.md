# Welcome to the GitHub tutorial
We will go over some basic forking and pull requests in this short tutorial.

# 1. Forking
Forking means making a copy of a GitHub repository into your own account. Here's a link to the GitHub documentation on forking: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ for further information.

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

To fork the `ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial` repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the main page of the `beginners-tutorial` repository: https://github.com/ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial
2. Click the Fork icon on the top right corner of the page.
3. Once the screen finishes loading, you will be redirected to a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

The top left corner of your screen should say

* username/beginners-tutorial
* forked from ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial

# 2. Keeping your fork in sync
Your copy of the repository will not be automatically updated whenever the original repository (more commonly called the `upstream` repository) changes. If there are any updates to the upstream repository, your copy will not receive these changes until you sync your fork.

You will know if your fork needs to be synced if you see a similar message in your repository: 

> This branch is 4 commits behind ubcchemecar:master.

To sync your fork, follow these [steps outlined in this website](http://www.hpique.com/2013/09/updating-a-fork-directly-from-github/), as follows:

1. Open the main page of your fork in GitHub
2. Click the 'Pull Request' icon
3. Click the 'Switching the Base' link
4. Click on the green 'Create a Pull Request' button
5. Type a title of your choice and the green button again
6. Scroll down and click the green 'Merge Pull Request' button and 'Confirm Merge'

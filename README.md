# Welcome
Please follow this guide if you're interested in working with the software/electrical team. We are assuming that you'll be using a Windows machine but the steps are very similar for Macs too.

# 1. Download Tools
Please install the following tools:

- Sublime Text 3: https://www.sublimetext.com/3
- Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

# 2. Set Up GitHub Repository
1. Sign up for a free account at www.github.com
2. Create a new repository (use the '+' plus icon at the top right corner of your screen), name your repository `<username>.github.io` (without the brackets <>, replace username with your Github username). Use the following settings: Public and tick 'Initialize this repository with a README'.
3. Navigate to the repository and create a new empty file called `index.html`.

# 3. Clone the repository
1. Navigate back to the repository and click the green `Clone or Download` button and select 'Open in Desktop'.
2. Select a folder to save the repository into.

# 4. Edit the index.html file
1. Using Sublime Text, go to 'File' and select 'Open Folder', then choose the folder where you saved the repository in.
2. Open the index.html file
3. Type in the following code:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>My first site</title>
</head>
<body>
  Hello World
</body>
</html>
```

4. Save the file and open index.html in your browser. You should see a webpage with the title `My first site` and `Hello world` as the contents.

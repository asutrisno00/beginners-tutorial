# Welcome to Tutorial 2 - Javascript (JS)
Javascript is the programming language of webpages that allows users to access, manipulate and store data. This tutorial will be examining the process of getting data from another webserver (an API) and implementing into your own webpage using a library of JS known as 'jQuery'

# 1. Acquire the jQuery library
Add the jQuery library by either method:

- Copy and paste: ```html <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>``` into the ```html <head>``` element 

- Go to https://jquery.com/download/ and right-click the compressed, production jQuery library, click 'Save link as', and save the folder in your repository folder

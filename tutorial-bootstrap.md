# Welcome to Tutorial x: Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites.

### What is a reponsive site
A responsive site “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop or a 4-inch smartphone screen. With responsive design, we don't need to create different versions of the same website to make it look good on different screen sizes.

### For Example...
The site that you've made using raw HTML in Tutorial 1 would look the same whether it's viewed on a mobile screen or on a desktop computer. Depending on your layout, it might be difficult to read some of the contents or text for your website unless you zoom in on your phone. 

> Day by day, the number of devices, platforms, and browsers that need to work with your site grows. Responsive web design represents a fundamental shift in how we’ll build websites for the decade to come. - Jeffrey Veen

Almost all modern websites are responsive sites, and you've probably noticed this too. For example, the layout for the [Vancouver Sun](http://vancouversun.com/) and the [UBC website](www.ubc.ca) looks different depending on whether you're looking at it on a mobile screen or on a full-sized monitor. Here are some more examples of responsive design: http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/

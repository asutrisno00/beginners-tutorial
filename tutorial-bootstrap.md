# Welcome to Tutorial x: Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites.

### Responsive Sites
A responsive site “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop or a 4-inch smartphone screen. With responsive design, we don't need to create different versions of the same website to make it look good on different screen sizes.

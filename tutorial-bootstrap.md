# Welcome to the Bootstrap Tutorial
Bootstrap is a popular framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites.

### What is a reponsive site
A responsive site “responds to” or resizes itself depending on the type of device it is being seen through. That could be an oversized desktop computer monitor, a laptop or a 4-inch smartphone screen. With responsive design, we don't need to create different versions of the same website to make it look good on different screen sizes.

### For Example...
The site that you've made using raw HTML in Tutorial 1 would look the same whether it's viewed on a mobile screen or on a desktop computer. Depending on your layout, it might be difficult to read some of the contents or text for your website unless you zoom in on your phone. 

> Day by day, the number of devices, platforms, and browsers that need to work with your site grows. Responsive web design represents a fundamental shift in how we’ll build websites for the decade to come. - Jeffrey Veen

Almost all modern websites are responsive sites, and you've probably noticed this too. For example, the layout for the [Vancouver Sun](http://vancouversun.com/) and the [UBC website](www.ubc.ca) looks different depending on whether you're looking at it on a mobile screen or on a full-sized monitor. Here are some more examples of responsive design: http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/

# 1. Intro to Bootstrap
As mentioned, Bootstrap provides a framework for creating responsive sites. You don't need to use a framework to make a website, you can always write raw HTML code as you've done in Tutorial 1, but there are plenty of good reasons to use one:

- Prevent repetition between projects
- Utilize responsive design to allow your website to adapt to various screen sizes – mobile, desktop, and everything in between
- Add consistency to design and code between projects and between developers
- Quickly and easily prototype new designs
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

# 2. Working with Bootstrap
1. Watch this 15-minute video for an excellent intro to Bootstrap and a tutorial on making your first Boostrap site: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no-Ntkc836w
2. Take a look at this article too for some further examples: https://www.sitepoint.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial-handling-complex-designs/

# 3. Project: Create a page using Bootstrap on your site
1. Select a Bootstrap theme that you like (or from any other website, just Google for free Bootstrap themes) from the list below. If you prefer, you can also code a Bootstrap page from scratch, based on what you've learned in Step 2.

2. Create another page with the Bootstrap theme (call it anything you want, i.e. bootstrap.html) and link to it from your main page (i.e. index.html). If you prefer, you can also overwrite your index.html page with the Bootstrap page.

# Further Reading
- If you prefer, you can also use a Bootstrap theme: https://startbootstrap.com/ and many other ones available online, Google Bootstrap themes or Bootstrap templates.
- If you haven't yet, read the [Learn Enough Git tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial). By now you should be comfortable with concepts such as forks, pull requests and other commands such as `git commit`, `git pull` and `git push`.

# Welcome to Tutorial 3: Server-side Scripts

In this tutorial, we will implement a simplified version of Doge Weather. http://dogeweather.com/

We will be using [Node.js](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_introduction.htm), a JavaScript platform for building web apps. We will then upload the web app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a free hosting service.

# 1: Sign Up For a Free Heroku Account

3. Click New and create a new App, you can name it anything you want.

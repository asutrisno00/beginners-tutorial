# Welcome to the GitHub tutorial
We will go over some basic forking and pull requests in this short tutorial.

# 1. Forking
Forking means making a copy of a GitHub repository into your own account. Here's a link to the GitHub documentation on forking: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ for further information.

> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

In this step, you will fork the `ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial` repository.

1. Go to the main page of the `beginners-tutorial` repository: https://github.com/ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial
2. Click the Fork icon on the top right corner of the page.
3. Once the screen finishes loading, you will be redirected to a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

The top left corner of your screen should say

username/beginners-tutorial
forked from ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial

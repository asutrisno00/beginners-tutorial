# Tutorial 3 - Project
1. Follow our Orgchart tutorial in the Chem-E-Car blog and create a mock orgchart in your website as a separate page (name it orgchart.html or something similar): http://www.ubcchemecar.com/blog/2016/12/24/orgcharts/
2. You can write random names and roles or partially/fully reproduce the Chem-E-Car junior team orgchart, it's up to you.
3. In your main page, index.html, create a link to your orgchart.html page.
